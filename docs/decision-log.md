## Where things stand — 2026-08-25

| Track | Status |
|---|---|
| **Hardware supplier** | J-Style **parked, not closed**. Both candidate bands failed validation; continuous raw PPG needs firmware customization at USD 15k NRE / 5,000 MOQ — premature for Phase 0. Awaiting their answer on a pilot batch. |
| **Path 2 — fans' own watches** | **Phase 1 validated in the field.** Live heart rate over Web Bluetooth, 1.004 readings/s, self-healing reconnection, R-R intervals. |
| **Backend** | Railway trial had expired and paused all services; upgraded to Hobby, `/health` responding again. |
| **Frontend** | Deployed on Vercel via its native git integration. Preview builds work per branch. |
| **Pilot (Tasha & Tracie, 2026-09-25)** | On track and **decoupled from the supplier decision**. |

### Open items

1. **Merge this branch to `main`.** Needed for two reasons: the CORS fix that
   allows Vercel preview origins only reaches the deployed backend from `main`,
   and the production URL has no Vercel login wall — which the 3–5 person field
   test requires.
2. **End-to-end save test** — capture → session → peak detection → card, now
   that the backend is back.
3. **J-Style reply** — awaiting their answer on a pilot batch and NRE credit.
4. **Veepoo** — contacted 2026-08-18, still the primary alternative if they
   confirm native raw PPG / R-R streaming.
5. **Deployment protection** — Vercel previews require login. Decide before
   2026-09-25 whether to disable it or run the field test on production.

## 2026-08-25 — J-Style: park, do not close

They confirmed our findings in writing and offered firmware customization:
**USD 15,000 NRE, 5,000-unit MOQ**.

**Decision: park.** The decisive number is the MOQ, not the NRE — at USD 40–80
per unit that is USD 200–400k of inventory committed *before* Phase 0 validates
that people want this at all. Firmware customization also runs 2–4 months, past
the pilot, and the continuous-streaming firmware does not exist yet, so
technical risk survives payment until an acceptance test proves otherwise.

Two questions asked before archiving: whether a 50–100 unit pilot batch with the
custom firmware is possible, and whether the NRE can be credited against a
future volume order.

## 2026-08-24 — Two verdicts in one day

### The V8 failed all three acceptance criteria

Eight bench runs on the Samsung A17, closing with a Polar H10-referenced
protocol: amplitude ratio **0.34** (needs ≥0.85), peak delay **+42 to +54 s**
or never reached (needs ≤5 s), MAE **17.5** (needs ≤5). Through 30 s of maximum
effort the device reported a flat 78–82 bpm while the reference climbed to 128.

Raw PPG proved **not reproducible**: zero packets across three independent
command configurations and 32 measurement commands.

**Method note worth keeping:** the two series were aligned by *absolute wall
clock*, deliberately rejecting MAE-minimising cross-correlation. With a device
whose defect *is* a systematic lag, that method absorbs the lag into the fitted
offset and hides it — it would have reported a spurious +19 to +25 s "clock
offset". Any future candidate is aligned the same way.

### Path 2, Phase 1 built and validated

Live capture over the standard Bluetooth Heart Rate Service (0x180D), reached
with **no native code**. Validated by replaying the 539 real GATT frames the
Polar emitted during the protocol: this parser and `tumtum_ble.py` agree on
100% of them, including all 835 R-R intervals. Then in the field: 240 readings
in 239 s, reconnection recovering on its own after the strap was removed.

**Decision that shaped the roadmap:** take the free win before investing in
native. A PWA cannot read HealthKit or Health Connect — but it *can* speak
standard BLE on Android Chrome, which validates the whole pipeline end to end
and, with the file import, carries the 25/09 pilot without app-store review.

### Three defects only a real device exposed

- **Tailwind had never compiled in any deployment.** No `postcss.config.js`, so
  Next.js never ran the PostCSS plugin: `@tailwind` directives were emitted
  verbatim, no utility classes generated, and the build succeeded anyway. The
  app had rendered as unstyled HTML since April.
- **Browsers that expose `navigator.bluetooth` without implementing the chooser**
  (Samsung Internet) left the UI on "Conectando..." forever. Now detected up
  front, with an 8-second watchdog behind it.
- **The elapsed clock restarted on every reconnection** — the monitor captures
  its state callback once, so the guard read a frozen `startedAt`.

### Infrastructure archaeology

- The **GitHub Actions deploy workflow has never worked** — 11 runs, all failed,
  since April. Deployment happens through Vercel's own git integration, which is
  why the app was live regardless.
- **Railway's trial had expired**, pausing all three services. Upgraded to Hobby
  rather than migrating: free tiers sleep after ~15 minutes idle, and a
  50-second cold start during a live event is unacceptable.

## 2026-08-20/21 — The SDK arrives, and the second path opens

J-Style confirmed in writing that the motion filter is firmware and **cannot be
disabled** — no fast-response mode. That closed Path A (processed BPM).

Analysis of the ~150 MB SDK drop found that the V8 Android SDK exposes **raw PPG
streaming** (`setECGRealtimeDuringHRVEnabled(true)` during an HRV measurement),
which would bypass the firmware algorithm entirely. That became Path B, and the
spike kit was built to test it: an instrumented vendor demo, a CI-built APK
published to the `spike-apk` release, and `analyze_ppg.py`.

Also found: the SDK is a frame assembler only, its documentation is
machine-translated and self-contradictory, and R-R constants exist in every
parser with no method to activate them.

## 2026-08-17 — Both bands fail, and the strategy splits

GATT inspection: neither the V8 nor the 2208A exposes the standard Heart Rate
Service (0x180D). The V8's Phase 1 protocol failed against the Polar H10, with
the diagnosis that mattered: **accelerometer-conditioned motion gating**.
Stationary, the firmware treats a fast rise as artefact and clamps the ramp;
in motion it releases tracking. MAE < 2 in steady state — the sensor is good,
the firmware is not.

**Two decisions came out of this:**

1. **The stationary condition became eliminatory** in the validation protocol.
   It is the product's core case: an emotional peak with the body still.
2. **Path 2 was born** — heart rate from fans' own watches — explicitly to
   decouple the pilot from the supplier crisis.

Veepoo contacted 2026-08-18 as the alternative with native raw data.

## Reusable knowledge

- **The validation protocol**: three blocks of 60 s rest / 30 s maximum effort /
  90 s seated recovery, against a Polar H10, in **two conditions** (stationary
  and moving). Criteria: amplitude ratio ≥ 0.85, peak delay ≤ 5 s, MAE ≤ 5.
  Stationary is eliminatory. Every candidate source passes through it — a band,
  a watch, or our own capture layer.
- **Alignment uses absolute clocks**, never MAE minimisation. See 2026-08-24.
- **J-Style protocol facts** (measurement duration in seconds, 8–9 s sensor
  warm-up, a start command being a no-op while a session is active) are recorded
  in `docs/jstyle-v8-evaluation.md` §4.3, should that relationship resume.
